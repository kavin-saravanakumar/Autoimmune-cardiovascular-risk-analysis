# Autoimmune-cardiovascular-risk-analysis
A research study analyzing how antibody-driven autoimmune responses contribute to cardiovascular disease development. The project investigates how specific immune irregularities influence heart health and tests computational methods for identifying these correlations through biomedical data.

Research Question:
How do antibody-influenced immune responses affect cardiovascular health, and what computational methods can best visualize this correlation?

Features:

Processed and analyzed biomedical datasets with immune and cardiac parameters.

Explored multiple prediction models (e.g., linear regression, random forest).

Visualized correlations between immune biomarkers and cardiovascular outcomes.

Derived insights supporting early detection of autoimmune-related cardiovascular risks.

Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
