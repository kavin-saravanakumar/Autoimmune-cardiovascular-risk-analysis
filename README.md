Project Overview

This research project investigates how autoimmune disorders influence cardiovascular health and explores how computational methods can be used to predict disease risk. Using machine learning models, the study analyzes specialized biomarkers to identify patterns of elevated cardiovascular risk associated with autoimmune activity.

Research Question

How do antibody-mediated responses in autoimmune conditions affect cardiovascular outcomes, and which computational models are most effective for prediction and visualization?

Features

Collection and normalization of biomedical datasets, including inflammatory biomarkers and cardiac outcomes.

Development of machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression) to predict cardiovascular risk profiles.

Data visualization to highlight key associations between autoimmune activity and heart disease.

Validation of findings by an engineering PhD researcher.

Technologies Used

Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

Machine learning techniques including regression analysis and predictive modeling

Data visualization for scientific interpretation

Research Impact

Identifies previously hidden correlations between autoimmune disorders and cardiovascular disease.

Provides a framework for computational modeling in biomedical research.

Currently under peer review for publication in the Youth Research Exchange, a student-led research platform.
